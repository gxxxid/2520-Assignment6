Code Documentation:

Program Objective lines 1-245:
	Make the program easy to adapt to other programs and for modularity. 

Modification to clouds (lines 51-86):
	Added a function draw_cloud(x, y) to encapsulate the drawing logic for the cloud, which takes in the cloud's coordinates (x, y) as input parameters.
Moved the cloud drawing logic from the main game loop to the draw_cloud() function, and replaced the previously hard-coded color values with the cloud_color variable that is determined based on the day variable.

Refresh rate (line 19) : 
	Allowed the user to choose the refresh rate

Lights-on(line 92-103):
	Allowed the user to use a True or False value for lights 
	Added two boolean variables, day and lights_on, to represent the current state of the day/night cycle and lights status respectively.
Wrapped the event processing logic inside a for loop that iterates over all events in the event queue using pygame.event.get().
Added event handling for two keys: 'l' to toggle the lights on/off, and 'd' to toggle between day and night mode.
Modified the game logic to use the day and lights_on variables to determine the appropriate colors for the sky, field, stripe, cloud, and fence based on the current state.

The modifications made to the code to allow for user input to control the day/night cycle and toggle the lights on/off:
	These modifications allow the user to control the day/night cycle and toggle the lights on/off by pressing the 'd' and 'l' keys respectively during the game loop.
